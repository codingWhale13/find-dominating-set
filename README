Backtrack algorithm in C++ to find a minimum dominating set for a given graph.

Compile:

	Just use 'make'

Running:

	./findDomSet < in > out
		in: graph in the following format:
			3 (Number of vertices)
			1 1 (Vertex Degree and its neighbours)
			2 0 1 (Vertex Degree and its neighbours)
			1 1 (Vertex Degree and its neighbours)

	run.sh: Script for testing different graph of 20 up to 60 vertices.
