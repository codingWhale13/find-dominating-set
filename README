Backtrack algorithm in C++ to find a minimum dominating set for a given graph.

Compile:

	Just use 'make'

Running:

	./run <input folder> <algorithm1, algorithm2, ..., algorithmN>

		Graphs must in the input folder and in the following format (Example):
			3 (Number of vertices)
			1 1 (Vertex Degree and its neighbours)
			2 0 1 (Vertex Degree and its neighbours)
			1 1 (Vertex Degree and its neighbours)
